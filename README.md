# Overview
Welcome to Holden's repository for processing Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius ludovicianus) Novoseq data and downstream population structure analysis :)

## Snakemake Pipeline
The snakemake pipeline is adapted from eriq's mega-non-model-wgs-snakeflow that has been tooled for specific use on BGP shrike data. Compare the two repositories right here: https://github.com/eriqande/mega-non-model-wgs-snakeflow/compare/main...foxholden:mega-non-model-wgs-snakeflow:LOSH-Apr-24

## PCA
Use plink to create a genomic pca and plot with R

## Admixture
Hopefully I will get to the Admixture analysis using either NGSAdmix or STRUCTURE
