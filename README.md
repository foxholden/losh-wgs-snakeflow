# Overview
Welcome to Holden's repository for processing Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius ludovicianus) Novoseq data and downstream population structure analysis :)


## Snakemake Pipeline
The snakemake pipeline detailed here is adapted from eriq's mega-non-model-wgs-snakeflow that has been tooled for specific use on BGP shrike data

## Analyis
PCA using plink
Hopefully I will get to Admixture using NGSAdmix or STRUCTURE
